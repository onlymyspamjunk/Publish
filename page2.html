Please mention in the request that all that's needed to be done to stop deliveries in error at wrong doors and stop losing packages is simply to place building numbers above unit numbers. Many thanks!!!</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>PROPOSAL TO THE DEVELOPER HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM: Please affix house numbers above unit numbers. This will solve this headache once and for all</strong></p><p><strong>Nature of the problem: This ambiguous labeling of units is the most annoying problem, and one of the most important ones, no doubt. And this problem needs to be fixed ASAP, but make no mistake, this problem must be fixed before the builder leaves the construction, and NOT by HOA</strong></p><p><strong>After the builder leaves the construction</strong>, we might be stuck with this problem for good and have this headache as long as we live here. </p><p>No doubt, everybody in the community found their packages dropped off at wrong doors, some of us more times than others. Some a lot more than the others depending on where they live in the community. Some packages were lost! This problem is complex and needs to be explained in detail. It seems the builder does not realize the severity of this problem and for well more than a half a year the problem was ignored despite MULTIPLE complaints from many people.</p><p>So, this is what is happening on daily basis to many of us and the problem is two-fold:</p><p><strong>1) Packages are being dropped off at the first building instead of the one they really need to go to.
</strong><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>The way that our community is built (buildings 1250 through 1260) is sort of an outlier for the surrounding neighborhoods as such and for Detroit avenue in particular. Usually in the neighborhood there are no "other" buildings "hiding" behind the front building which in our case stands out and "hides" other buildings behind it. Many times you could hear from people visiting somebody in the community and ringing wrong doors “oh, I did not know there were more buildings behind this one”… Happens all the time! People often just match the unit number mixing the buildings.
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>Naturally, delivery people that are not familiar with this think (regretfully) that any building (i.e. 1250, 1252, 1254, 1256, 1258, 1260) is actually this FIRST building (1250) and frequently in error drop packages off at that first building. Then, naturally, when the packages are not being picked up (since they were delivered to the wrong door to begin with) and left overnight on a busy street they are likely to be stolen. So the people that live in that first building often bring packages to proper doors and often front office personnel does this. But this is not the solution; instead this is simply accepting and justifying the problem.
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>Why is this happening? As a delivery person (especially a contractor that works in this area just for one day and tomorrow will be gone and another contractor will be hired tomorrow) drives down Detroit avenue and that delivery person in a hurry needs to deliver a package to an addressee in our community between our neighbor Castilian Apartments (at 1236) and the other our neighbor on the other side of us (residential building at 1290), the delivery person in error just ASSUMES that whatever is in between those addresses is the building he or she is looking for… Wrong! The problem often times is that the delivery people do not bother to look for the actual building number. In a rush they just look at the unit number and drop the package just matching the unit number, AND NOT THE BUILDING. 
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>The builder and the seller (the front office) despite the frustration of some of us that were talking to them repeatedly were always saying it is not their problem and that every one of us has to talk to carriers that make this very frequent mistake. Please don’t! This is super counterproductive and is going to solidify this problem to stay with us forever, for as long as we live here.
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>Why this IS counterproductive? The turnaround of contractors delivering packages for various companies is too much for anybody to handle. Even for all of us individually. We CANNOT educate each and every one of them. And we should not! To think that their every new manager is going to teach every new contractor being hired there for a day or two about our home complex situation is just laughable, it is simply ridiculous and IS total ABSURD. So please do not be this naive, because you will be doing yourself a bad favor and firm up this problem even more.
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>What if the building numbers will be made bigger? What if there will be a sign at the front depicting the buildings' layout? What if…?
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>…Oh, please don’t! Please no more whatifs. This will be counterproductive and by implementing these excuses of a solution the builder and the seller are just spinning the issue. The ROOT of the PROBLEM needs to be fixed, nothing else will do. Building numbers need to be placed above unit numbers, nothing else will do. Because many delivery people are just not going to look at a building number to begin with because of the reasons mentioned above. And this is exactly what they say when you catch them dropping packages at a wrong building!!! That is their own testimony and excuse of why this happens. They ASSUME that this is the right building, and that is simply it. After all, there IS a building number there already, they don’t bother to look at it! That is the predicament. 
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>Making a big sign some place depicting buildings and showing that there are more buildings than just that first one facing the road is totally pointless and is a waste of money that will not solve anything. Because they are not going to look for it. You need to understand the situation and some of us understood it long ago and discussed it back and forth. It is rather simple. They are getting paid bare minimum and they have a lot of packages to deliver in a short period of time and they are working here just for a day or two, they are not going to make a lot of effort understanding that our complex is an outlier different from others in this neighborhood. And they don’t have to! They see the building between the two addresses (1236 and 1290), they ASSUME that this is the right one without looking at the building number and they drop their package off only matching a UNIT number. So the only way to make a delivery person to see this is the wrong building is to put a building number above each unit number, no other working solution here. AT ALL. Please don’t be fooled.
</p><p><strong>2)	Deliveries are being made in error to wrong doors even if the packages are not being dropped off in error at the first building.
</strong><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>So, the problem truly is two-fold. Delivery people, even if they manage to notice somehow that there are more buildings behind the first one still drop packages off at wrong doors. This problem is a bit less painful than the described above (since packages are stolen less often or almost never), but still rather frequent and still a headache since you still need to hunt for your package, or somebody needs to bring it to you.
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p>Why is this happening? Again and again, simply, delivery people do not look at building numbers, regretfully. Making numbers bigger will not help! They rush into the complex, they see the unit number matching their unit number on the package and they still drop off the package at a wrong door. Why? According to them they ASSUME that unit numbers are unique (as they almost always are in apartment complexes and our complex sure looks like an apartment complex according to many people). People who are visiting residents in our community also make this very mistake assuming that the unit numbers are unique and sometimes ring wrong doors.
 Sad, but true.<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;"></span></p><p><strong>So, this is a MESS. Only affixing numbers above unit numbers will solve these issues. Nothing else will do.</strong></p><p>If you've read this far... Thanks! &nbsp;<strong>Please help resolve this annoying problem</strong>, please, in addition to spending a couple of minutes and filing a Service Request at <a href="https://www.discoveryhomes.com/homeowner-warranty">https://www.discoveryhomes.com/homeowner-warranty</a> -&gt; Submit Service Request also call Seeno Homes Customer Service at <strong>925-671-7711</strong> and spend just a few minutes, address this problem to them and ask them to FIX it.

That's quite possibly why the parking along the drive is parallel to the curb instead of at an angle. Questionable though because it depends on length of a parked vehicle to clear that 20 feet. And it seems like it should clear that 20 feet... Some measurements need to be made to clarify this and to post the test results. But at the same time this totally does not explain why there is a fire lane no parking painted on the curb AFTER the mailbox after just 2 parking spots there. Because the distance from buildings to cars there is almost whopping <strong>30 feet</strong>! Many cars could be parked there, LEGALLY. So it is really puzzling as to why the parking is banned over there.</p></blockquote>
